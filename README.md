# React Recipe Finder: Search and Discover Delicious Recipes

This project is a simple recipe search application that allows users to search for recipes by entering keywords in a search bar and clicking a search button. The application utilizes an API to retrieve recipe data and displays the results in a user-friendly format. The search bar and button are designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly find the recipes they are looking for. The application is built using Reactjs.
